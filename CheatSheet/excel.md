### Fill Down

Sometimes you want to fill down a column with the same value or formula

#### Method 1

- Select the cell you want to fill down
- Click and hold the bottom right corner of the cell (the cursor should change to a cross)
- Drag the cell down to the last cell you want to fill down

#### Method 2

- Select the cell you want to fill down
- Hold down the `shift` key and press `down arrow` (or click on the last cell you want to fill down)
- Click `cmd + d` to fill down the column

---

### Sort

You can sort selected cells, columns, rows or the entire sheet

- Select the cells, columns, rows or the entire sheet you want to sort (e.g. click on the top left square to select the entire sheet)
- Click on the "Data" menu and select "Sort range" -> "Advanced range sorting options"
- If the sheet has a header row, check the "Data has header row" checkbox
- Select the column you want to sort by
- Select the order you want to sort by (e.g. "A to Z")
- Click on the "Sort" button

---

### Filter

You can filter selected cells, columns, rows or the entire sheet

#### Create a filter vs Filter Views

- **Filter views**: The filter will be applied to the sheet and will be visible only to you
- **Create a filter**: The filter will be applied to the sheet and will be visible to everyone who has access to the sheet

#### Filter views

- Click on the "Data" menu and select "Filter views" -> "Create new filter view"
- Select the column you want to filter by
- Select the condition you want to filter by (e.g. "Greater than")
- Enter the value you want to filter by (e.g. 10)
- Click on the "OK" button
- Choose a name for the filter view (e.g. "Only sales from Arizona")

### Pivot Table

A Pivot Table allows you to summarize data from a table into a new table

- Select the cells you want to include in the pivot table
- Click on the "Insert" menu and select "Pivot table"

> Note: A new sheet will be created with the pivot table

- Go to the "Pivot table editor" section on the right
- Select either the suggested pivot table or create your own by selecting the columns, rows, values or filters you want to include in the pivot table
- Click on the "Add" button

> TIP: You can then insert a chart based on the pivot table

---

### Lookup Table

A lookup table allows you to lookup a value in a table and return a value from another column in the same row

- Create a table with the values you want to lookup:

> Note: Those are simply two columns with values that you can put anywhere in the sheet

| B   | C        |
| --- | -------- |
| CR  | Chrysler |
| FD  | Ford     |

- Sort the table by the first column (e.g. "B"), if not the sorted, the lookup will not work

> See [Sort](#sort)

- Select the new cell you want to return the value to
- Enter the formula `=VLOOKUP(A1, B$1:C$2, 2)`

> Note: `A1` is the value you want to lookup (which in this case is placed in the A column), `B$1:C$2` is the table you want to lookup the value in, `2` is the lookup table column number you want to return the value from
>
> We used an absolute reference for the table because we want to be able to copy the formula to other cells

---

### General Tips

- You can use the `=` operator to convert a value to a number (e.g. `=A1*2`)
- You can click on a column header to select the entire column
- You can add a column by right clicking on a column header and selecting "Insert 1 left"
- You can calculate the number of days between two dates by subtracting them (e.g. `=A1-A2`)
- Double click on the column right border to auto resize the column to fit the content
- You can rotate text in a cell by selecting the cell and then clicking on the "Text Rotation" button in the toolbar
- You can either use `.5` or `50%` to represent 50%
